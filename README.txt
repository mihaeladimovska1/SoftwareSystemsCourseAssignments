Assignment 1: 
Implement a basic HTTP server that supports directory listing, static files, and CGI scripts. The server needs to run on a Linux server environment, such as those supported in our lab machines. Additionally, you will also have to write a sample CGI shell script that can be executed by your web server.
Specifically, your web server needs to support the following features:
1. Single connection mode (serial) and multiple connection mode (parallel with multiple threads)
2. HTTP GET requests with query and header parsing
3. Automatic directory listing
4. Static file transport
5. Basic CGI support by running a sample CGI script on the server side

Assignment 2:
Implement map-reduce for counting words in a corpus of Sheakspeare works.
